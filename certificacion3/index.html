                Javascript is the programing language that you should use in order to add interactive characteristics to
                your website.
                Like interactive styles what will change when you push a button or click on an input.
            </p>

                But, what is really Javascript?
            </p>
            <p>
                is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan
                Eich.

                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools
                on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.

                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the <span>let</span>
                keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
            </p>
            <code>
                let myVariable;
            </code>
            <p>
                You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems
                in your code, check the case!
            </p>
            <p>
                After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
            </p>
            <code>
                myVariable = "Bob";
            </code>
            <p>
                Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
            </p>
            <code>
                let myVariable = "Bob";
            </code>
            <p>
                After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:
            </p>
            <code>
                let myVariable = "Bob";<br>
                myVariable = "Steve";
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>
                <h2>Data Types</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>String</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in
                    single quote marks.
                </p>
                <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Number</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.
                </p>
                <code>
                    let myVariable = 10;
                </code>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Boolean</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote
                    marks.
                </p>
                <code>let myVariable = true;</code>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Array</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.
                </p>
                <code>let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];</code>
                <p>Refer to each member of the array like this:</p>
                <code>myVariable[0], myVariable[1],</code>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Object</h4>
                <p>
                    This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep
                    this in mind as you learn.
                </p>
                <code>let myVariable = {name: 'Joe', last_name: 'Mama'}</code>
            </div>
            <p>
                So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If
                values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or
                change an image displayed in an image gallery.

        <section class="main-section" id="Comments_and_Operators">
            <header>
                <h2>Comments and Operators</h2>
            </header>
            <div>
                <h4>Comments</h4>
                <p>
                    Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as
                    comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:
                </p>
                <code>
                    /* Everything in between is a comment. */
                </code>
                <p>
                    If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    // This is a comment
                </code>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Operators</h4>
                <p>
                    An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). You
                    can see some of the simplest operators:
                </p>

                        <td>These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.</td>
                        <td><code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code></td>
                        <td>

                        <td>Strict equality</td>
                        <td>This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a
                            <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> (Boolean) result.
                        </td>
                        <td><code>===</code></td>
                        <td><code>let myVariable = 3;
                            myVariable === 4; // false</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Not, Does-not-equal</td>
                        <td>This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false,
                            etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether
                            two values are not equal.</td>
                        <td><code>!</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>!==</code></td>
                        <td>
                            For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate
                            it:<br>
                            <code>
                                let myVariable = 3; <br>
                                !(myVariable === 3) // false;
                            </code><br>
                            "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing
                            "is <code>myVariable</code> NOT equal to 3". This returns <code>false</code> because
                            <code>myVariable</code> IS equal to 3:<br>
                            <code>
                                let myVariable = 3; <br>
                                myVariable !== 3;
                            </code>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now.

                <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common
                form of conditionals is the if...else statement. For example:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code">
                    let iceCream = "chocolate";<br>
                    if (iceCream === "chocolate") {<br>
                        alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");<br>
                        } else {<br>
                          alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite…");<br>
                    }
                </code>
            <p>
                The expression inside the if () is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above)
                to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this
                comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block
                of code—after the else statement—runs instead.

                <h2>Functions</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of
                code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good
                alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions. For
                example:
            </p>
            <code class="block-code">
                    function greeting(){<br>
                        alert('Heloooooo!')<br>
                    }<br>
                    greeting();<br>
                </code>
            <p>
                If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— <code>()</code>
                —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job.
                Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the <code>alert()</code> function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but
                we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.
